## How Do Xbox Gift Cards Work?
Xbox gift cards are essentially digital currency used within the Xbox ecosystem. With an Xbox gift card, you can purchase:

- Xbox Live Gold subscriptions
- Xbox Game Pass subscriptions
- New video games from the Xbox Store
- In-game purchases such as skins, packs, and upgrades

These cards can be redeemed on your Xbox console, or even on the Microsoft Store website, to fund your gaming experience. Gift cards typically come in denominations like $10, $25, $50, or $100, and the 100 Xbox gift card is among the most popular options due to its versatility.

## Why Do People Look for Free Xbox Gift Card Codes?
Many gamers often look for free Xbox gift cards for various reasons:

1. **Cost-saving**: Not everyone has the budget to spend on Xbox gift cards, especially when new games or subscriptions are constantly being released.
2. **Increased Gaming Flexibility**: Free gift card codes give gamers the flexibility to make purchases without spending out-of-pocket money.
3. **Special Offers**: Sometimes, Xbox offers promotional gift cards or sales, but free codes are sought after to take advantage of such deals without extra expenditure.
4. **In-game Purchases**: Players who love customizing their avatars or buying special in-game content often rely on gift cards to make these purchases.

Given these reasons, understanding how to get free Xbox gift cards becomes a valuable skill for many players.
