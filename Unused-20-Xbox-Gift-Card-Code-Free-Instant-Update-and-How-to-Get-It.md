### What is an Xbox Gift Card?

An Xbox gift card is a prepaid digital code that can be redeemed on the Xbox console, Xbox Live, or the Microsoft Store. With these cards, you can purchase games, movies, add-ons, and subscriptions. They come in different values, such as $10, $20, $50, or $100. 

### How Does the $20 Xbox Gift Card Work?
